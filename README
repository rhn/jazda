Jazda is a bicycle computer based on AVR microcontrollers and mobile phone screens. The project covers both the software and hardware design, providing the source code and schematics.
Currently, it supports AtTiny2313. The microcontroller was chosen because of its popularity and resistance to damage. Support for AtMega8 is planned in the near future.
The other significant component is the screen. The project aims to be compatible with at least a few popular low-powered displays, but at the moment only one is supported.

FEATURES

calculates distance with arbitrary precision (set before compilation)
calculates speed at every impulse with arbitrary precision (set before compilation)
smart speed decreasing when no pulses come in (wheel stopped)
displays vector digits
partially modular design

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

LPH7366 display (Philips PCD8544 LCD driver)
  - 9-pin flex tape or a PCB with 1mm-spaced solder pads
Atmel AtTiny2313 microcontroller
2x 1ÂµF capacitors
3V power supply (2x1.4V batteries work fine)

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

gcc avr cross-compiler
avr-libc
avrdude
bash (for installation only)

SOFTWARE INSTALLATION

The software has been tested on Linux only.
To compile and download the software to the chip, go to src/ directory and run the command:

../build.sh usbasp t2313 main.c

replacing usbasp with the name of your programmer (refer to avrdude manual to find it).
For further information, refer to build.sh source code.
