/* Builtin calculating and displaying current speed.

Speed is calculated between first and last pulse in queue on redraw. A timer
event is set some time after the predicted next pulse. If the pulse comes, timer
is set again. If the pulse doesn't come, the timeout is considered the next
valid pulse (thus lowering the speed).
